# Simple-Neural-Network
Simple Feed-Forward Neural Network Algorithm Implemented using Matlab. Currently only uses Logistic Sigmoid Activation with Stochastic Gradient Descent with Mini-Batch.

- Use the NNCalc.m file to generate a neural network. 
- 3 sample data sets have been included
- Currently does not offer test, train splitting.
- Updates will be made soon
